### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently studying for my computer science bachelor at the [Technische UniversitÃ¤t Berlin](https://www.tu.berlin/en/).

This repository is used as my personal collection of self written code examples, frequently used utility classes or projects. Feel free to use or improve anything I post on this repository.

My current skillset includes (ordered by proficiency):
- C++
- C
- Python
- Java
- PHP

Simply because I think that X programming language is the language that I am currenly most proficient at doesn't mean that I also write good code in X programming language. This ranking is solely based on my personal opinion!

What I plan to pick up in the near future:
- Kotlin
- Go
- Rust
- Javascript -> Typescript
- C#
- Dart
