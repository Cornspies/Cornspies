### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm studying for my computer science bachelor (currently in transition to master's degree program) at the [Technische UniversitÃ¤t Berlin](https://www.tu.berlin/en/).

This repository is used as my personal collection of self written code examples, frequently used utility classes or projects. Feel free to use or improve anything I post on this repository.

My current skillset includes (ordered by proficiency and recency of use):
- C++
- C
- Javascript
- Kotlin/Java/C#/Go
- Python
- PHP

_Simply because I think that **X** programming language is the language that I am currenly most proficient at doesn't mean that I also write good code in **X** programming language. This ranking is solely based on my personal opinion!_

Actively using and learning:
- Go
- C#

What I plan to pick up in the near future:
- Rust
- Dart (Flutter)

### Have a nice day!
